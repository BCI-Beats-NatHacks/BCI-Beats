# BCI-Beats
A BCI music composition app, designed for NatHacks2023



Setting up the frontend:
- Done already, but just required importing the bci-essentials-unity package from their github page into unity


Setting up the python backend:

in your project main folder cmd, run python -m venv venv

activate it by running venv\Scripts\activate.bat
- you should now see (venv) before your directory
- where.exe python should show the venv path at the top
- if this doesn't work, your pc might have scripts disabled
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.3

now install the packages that are needed
- pip install bci-essentials
